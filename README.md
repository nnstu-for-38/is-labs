Repo for code review and tracking of implemented tasks.

List of tasks can be found [here](tasks.md)

## Directories structure

Please create a directory for your work based on your github username
or based on your surname. Inside it, create a separate directory for
each lab work: `1`, `2`, etc.

```
/
`-- username/
   |-- 1/
   |  `-- some content
   |-- 2/
   |  `-- some content
   `-- 3/
      `-- some content
```

## How to submit your work

Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Once it is merged, the lab work is considered to be accepted and
all you need is to bring a report (physical one, on paper, signed by you).

All discussions will be held either in PR comments or during offline
sessions.
